/* Description */
The code is very beta.  Please give it a shot and let me know where you hit snags.  
I've tested it in basic app using Containable and it works great.  
It probably doesn't work with $recursive.

/* Instructions */
1) Download the plugin to /app/plugins/cakephp_plugin_lazy
2) Put this either in your app_model.php or at the top of any model you want to use it:
   App::import('Model', 'cakephp_plugin_lazy.app_model');
3) Have your model extend LazyAppModel instead of AppModel.
